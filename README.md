### Made by :
- Anshuman Suri (2014021)
- Satyam Kumar (2014096)

### Instructions :
- Run the server via eclipse (uses Tomcat 8)
- Go to localhost:8080/LAB9/Home to view the user-end of the delivery system.
- Go to localhost:8080/LAB9/Manager to view the manager-end of the delivery system.

### Note :
- After a order is completed,it isn't deleted from the database/manager-end view,as it may be used in the future for some purposes (records)
- A unique order ID is generated only if the order is non-blank, that is, refreshing the page with blank information will not generate different order IDs.
